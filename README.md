# School Project 02-2019

This is a school project.

It's not an official website, carrying neither an imprint nor any legal information.

Please don't open it on your mobile as it will look terrible.
We designed it to look good on desktops only - may add some media queries later on.

Its purpose is to explain **network technologies** like:

- Protocols in general
- Ethernet & IP
- TCP & UDP
- FTP, HTTP & POP3
- Adressing in TCP/IP networks (class A, B and C networks, subnetworks)
- Current standards
